[View my Password Generator Application on Github Pages](https://samdemarco.github.io/random-password-generator/)

## Challenges

This was complex at first as I tried to use loops for data inputs which didn't work. After consulting with my best friend "Mr. Google" I started formulating the solution based on several examples I researched and applying a different thought process in utilizing funtions to chop up the work.
  
## Assignment Details 

Modify starter code provided to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
